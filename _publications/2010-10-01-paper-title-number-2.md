During 2022–2023, through extensive literature review, I developed a strong interest in how distractors influence retro-cue benefits in visual working memory (VWM). As first author, I completed a systematic review synthesizing modulating factors of interference effects in retro-cue studies and addressing inconsistencies in prior research. This work identified four key factors contributing to divergent findings: external vs. internal interference, interference timing, and cue type, while proposing potential cognitive mechanisms underlying these discrepancies. To better conceptualize these interactions, I constructed a three-dimensional cognitive model, providing a novel theoretical framework for future research. This project enhanced my ability to integrate multidisciplinary perspectives, critically evaluate methodological inconsistencies, and develop testable hypotheses—strengthening my skills in literature synthesis, theoretical modeling, and scientific writing
