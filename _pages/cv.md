Education
======
* Ph.D in Finland, University of Turku, 2025 
* M.S. in China, Sichuan Normal University, 2022
* B.S. in China, Southwest Medical University, 2018

Research experience
======
* Main Member of Delayed Distractor Effect Project, SCNU (PI: Dr. Chaoxiong Ye, 22.11.2023 – 9.9.2024)
   . Manipulate the appearance phase of distractors (encoding vs. delayed vs. both) to elucidate the mechanisms of distraction resistance in the context of complex real-world stimuli. Results indicate that the VWM 
     performance was significantly impaired by delay-stage distractors, but remained unaffected during the encoding stage. This dissociated VWM distraction effect results from the absence of processing distractors during 
     the encoding stage, rather than the appearance of distractors during the delay or their abrupt emergence.
   . Responsible for validation., review and editing.
  
* Main Member of Retro-cue Benefit Project, SCNU (PI: Dr. Chaoxiong Ye, 23.6.2023 –12.3.2024)
   . Based on a comprehensive review of prior relevant studies, four potential influencing factors—external interference, internal interference, interference temporal dynamics, and cue type—are identified to account for 
     the divergent findings observed in previous research. Furthermore, a cognitive model is proposed to elucidate the mechanisms by which interference affects the retrieval process of trace-back cues.
   . Complete a review article in Journal of Sichuan Normal University (Natural Science)as the first author.

* Attention Bias Summer Camp, online (5.2023 – 6.2023)

   . Assisted Prof. Hong-jin Sun (Associate Professor, Department of Psychology, Neuroscience & Behaviour, McMaster University) for this summer camp

   . Presented one lectures on attention and its interaction with visual working memory, and organize the symposium among attendees, including undergraduate students in McMaster University and graduate students in several 
     universities in China.

* The neural mechanism of visual working memory processing different familiarity and memory stimuli, (2.2024 – 7.2024)
  
   . Maintained close communication with Prof. Weizhen Xie (Associate Professor, Department of Psychology, University of California), participating in multiple online meetings to clarify project objectives and data 
     acquisition requirements.
   . As the lead researcher responsible for fMRI data acquisition, independently completed preparatory work, including parameter configuration, subject recruitment, ensuring data quality and delivering high-quality data on 
     schedule(75 participants), laying a solid foundation for subsequent project analysis.
  
Skills
======

Service and leadership
======
* Research Assistant of Ye’s Lab, SCNU (1.7.2023 – present)

    Managed laboratory-related matters.
  
    Assisted in drafting project proposals.
  
    Focus on visual working memory and its interaction with attention or emotion.
  
    Act as main member of two projects (details shown in following parts).
  
    Assist in an ERP study on memorability. Responsible for program coding in E-prime, data collection (60+), EEG data analysis via Matlab, visualization via OriginLab.
  
    Assist in a behavioral study on retro-cue and facial memorability. Responsible for program coding in E-prime, data collection (90+), analysis via SPSS and JASP, visualization.
  
    Have extensive experience in manuscript writing and revising according to reviewers ’ suggestion. Finish two manuscripts (two published)


* fMRI Operator(2023-2024)
  
    Leadership experience in the China Longitudinal Study of Brain and Cognitive Development in School-Aged Children Project in SCNU: assumed responsibility for the efficient and effective operation of the fMRI scanning 
    component of this large-scale longitudinal study. Duties included managing participant recruitment strategies, overseeing experimental preparation and protocol adherence, ensuring the integrity of data acquisition 
    procedures, and implementing rigorous quality control measures. Acquired high-quality FMRI data from 182 school-aged children and trained a new MRI scanner operator to independently conduct scanning sessions.
